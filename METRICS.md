# Success Metrics Framework

## Impact Measurement Hierarchy

### Leading Indicators (Real-Time Monitoring)

**Intelligence Operations:**
- Collection coverage: % of relevant sources monitored
- Profile completeness: % of targets with actionable intelligence  
- Intelligence products delivered to partners
- Partner utilization rate (are they using what we produce?)

**Advocate Network:**
- Active advocates (weekly activity)
- Actions completed (email, social, petition, etc.)
- Engagement rates (advocate → target interaction quality)
- Advocate retention (month-over-month)

**Coordination:**
- Partners in active coordination
- Campaigns using coordination support
- Timing alignment achieved (actions within optimal windows)
- Message consistency (avoiding bot-like uniformity)

**Optimization:**
- A/B tests completed
- Message improvement (optimized vs baseline performance)
- Targeting accuracy (right message, right person, right time)
- Resource efficiency (impact per dollar, per advocate-hour)

### Lagging Indicators (Quarterly/Annual)

**Campaign Outcomes:**
- Campaign wins with our involvement
- Attribution analysis (direct vs contributory vs ecosystem)
- Win rate vs movement baseline
- Time-to-win improvement

**Movement Impact:**
- Partner effectiveness improvement (measurable via their metrics)
- Movement coordination improvement (less duplication, better timing)
- Resource efficiency gains (more impact per dollar across movement)
- New capacity enabled (partners doing things they couldn't before)

**Strategic Progress:**
- Alternative protein market share trajectory
- Legislative progress (bills introduced, passed, implemented)
- Corporate commitments (number, scope, verification)
- Cultural shift metrics (polling, defaults, norms)

### Ultimate Outcomes (5-10 Year)

**Economic Victory:**
- Alternative protein price parity by category
- Subsidy reform enacted
- True cost accounting adopted
- Factory farming economically marginal

**Legal Victory:**
- Categorical practice prohibitions (5+ states)
- Enhanced welfare standards (federal)
- International framework progress
- Path to comprehensive prohibition clear

**Corporate Victory:**
- 50%+ of major corporations committed
- Supply chain transformation underway
- Industry responding to pressure, not leading
- Reputational toxicity established

**Cultural Victory:**
- Generational majority for animal protection
- Plant-based as default, animal products as exception
- Moral circle expansion normalized
- Social pressure inverted (eating animals uncomfortable)

## Attribution Methodology

### Direct Attribution
**What we can confidently claim:**
- Campaigns where we were primary coordinator
- Intelligence that directly influenced decisions
- Tools enabling specific partner actions
- Measurable outcomes from our campaigns

**Standard:** Clear causal chain, documented

### Contributory Attribution  
**What we likely contributed to:**
- Campaigns where we provided intelligence
- Outcomes where partners used our tools
- Coordination that improved timing/targeting
- Infrastructure enabling partner effectiveness

**Standard:** Plausible contribution, partner confirmation

### Ecosystem Attribution
**What we enabled indirectly:**
- Movement capacity improvements
- Coordination culture changes
- Shared intelligence raising all boats
- Compound effects across ecosystem

**Standard:** Difficult to measure, acknowledge uncertainty

## Measurement Challenges & Honesty

**We can measure:**
- Intelligence products created
- Campaigns coordinated
- Advocates activated
- Partner relationships

**We cannot perfectly measure:**
- Our specific contribution to wins (movements are complex)
- Counterfactual (what would have happened without us?)
- Long-term cultural effects (many factors)
- Indirect network effects

**Our commitment:**
- Measure what we can rigorously
- Estimate what we must with uncertainty bounds
- Acknowledge what we can't measure
- Don't overclaim attribution
- Partner testimony as validation

## Dashboard Visualization

**Real-Time:**
- Advocates active (today, this week)
- Actions in flight (scheduled, executing, completed)
- Campaigns in coordination windows
- Intelligence updates (what's new, what's urgent)

**Trends:**
- Campaign win rate over time
- Advocate network growth
- Partner engagement
- Resource efficiency trends

**Impact:**
- Corporate commitments timeline
- Legislative progress map
- Alternative protein trajectory
- Cultural shift dashboard
