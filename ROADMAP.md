- Self-sustaining partnership growth

### Years 3-5: Full Operations ($30-33M total, $10-11M/year)
**Team:** 28-35 people
**Focus:** Sustained multi-domain pressure, compound effects

**Deliverables:**
- 200+ partner organizations
- 100,000+ active advocates
- Simultaneous pressure across all 7 domains
- 25+ major corporate commitments
- 10+ state-level legal wins
- Measurable cultural baseline shift

### Years 6-10: Sustained Operations ($55-65M total, $11-13M/year)
**Team:** 28-35 people (mature stable size)
**Focus:** Maintain pressure, consolidate wins, prepare for prohibition

**Outcomes:**
- Majority of major food corporations committed to higher welfare
- Legal prohibition in 10+ jurisdictions
- Alternative protein price parity achieved
- Subsidy reform momentum established
- Cultural majority for animal protection
- Infrastructure for final prohibition push

## Seven-Domain Strategy

### Domain 1: Economic Displacement
**Goal:** Make factory farming economically nonviable

**Levers:**
- Alternative protein acceleration (R&D support, market intelligence)
- Subsidy reform (coalition building, legislative intelligence)
- Externality pricing (integrate with climate/health movements)
- Supply chain pressure (increase operational costs)

**Timeline:** 5-10 years to price parity

### Domain 2: Legal Prohibition  
**Goal:** Build toward comprehensive legal prohibition

**Sequence:**
- Phase 1: Strengthen existing welfare laws (Years 1-3)
- Phase 2: Categorical prohibitions of specific practices (Years 3-7)
- Phase 3: Broad jurisdictional prohibitions (Years 7-12)
- Phase 4: Federal/international frameworks (Years 10-20)

**Tactics:** Legislation, litigation, regulation

### Domain 3: Cultural Shift
**Goal:** Accelerate generational attitude change

**Mechanisms:**
- Exposure (investigations, documentation)
- Normalization (plant-based defaults everywhere)
- Social pressure (animal products become uncomfortable)
- Elite adoption (influencers model change)

**Timeline:** Already happening, we accelerate

### Domain 4: Corporate Accountability
**Goal:** Make factory farming reputationally toxic

**Cascade:**
- Early adopters commit → Fast followers see competitive pressure → Laggards face escalating pressure → Industry standard shifts

**Pressure vectors:** Investors, customers, employees, suppliers, media

### Domain 5: Movement Infrastructure
**Goal:** Multiply effectiveness of 100+ partner organizations

**Deliverables:**
- This coordination system
- Shared intelligence platform
- Campaign tools and templates
- Cross-org coordination mechanisms

**Impact:** Every org more effective, compound not additive

### Domain 6: Intelligence Operations
**Goal:** Information superiority over industry

**Capabilities:**
- Corporate intelligence (know their vulnerabilities)
- Political intelligence (know legislative landscape)
- Media intelligence (control narratives)
- Predictive intelligence (know what's coming)

**Output:** Better targeting, early warnings, strategic insight

### Domain 7: Technology & Optimization
**Goal:** Continuous improvement of all systems

**Focus:**
- Model development (persuasion, timing, messaging)
- Platform development (advocate UX, partner tools)
- Validation (what works, what doesn't)
- Security (protect operations)

## Resource Allocation by Domain
